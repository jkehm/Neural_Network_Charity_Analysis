# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis:

In this challenge we are helping Beks from Alphabet Soup create a binary classifier. This classifier will be able to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soup's business team received a CSV file with several differnt organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. The dataset contains the following columns for each orginization. 
* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Using this data we will create the following four deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
* Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
* Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)
### Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
###### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? **IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively**
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? **Every column except for IS-SUCCESSFUL**
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? **Starting out we dropped the EIN and NAME columns, but this did change**

###### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
